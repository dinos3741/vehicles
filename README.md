# vehicles
This is my attempt to create an artificial world with creatures who compete for food and avoid predators. 
The creatures act on external stimuli based on a set of rules defining their "behaviour" and implement a steering force
as the result. 
A simple classification NN was used (scikit-learn) but the real-time simulation suffered frame loss in real time.
